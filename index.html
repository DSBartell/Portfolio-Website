        <h3 class="text-center info">About Me</h3>
        <p class="text-center info">I'm Daniye Bartell from Chantilly Virginia, right next to Washington DC. Computer Science and programming have always been a hobby of mind, but recently I've decided to stop messing around and take it seriously as a career. Over the past few months I've seen my skills multiply by orders of magnitude and hopefully you'll give me an opportunity to show you that.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center info">Experience & Education</h3>
        <p class="text-center info">I've been programming as a hobbyist for about 3 years now, mostly using OOP languages like python and java. I moved on to Radford University and studied programming for 2 years there but decided to leave. Shortly thereafter I decided that while programming was a fun hobby, I ought to be taking it more seriously. I tore through Code Academy's classes on HTML, CSS, Sass, and Javascript. After that I followed other online tutorials but felt somewhat unprepared as a result of having my hand held throughout most of the tutorials. It wasn't until recently that I've been experimenting with many of my own programs and designs to finally come up with something I was truly satisfied with. That said, my focus and passion is absolutely in web development. Like many millenials, I don't know what I'd do without the internet. Since then, I've been building web apps with Bootstrap4, assorted API's like Axios and Google's Geocode and assorted other technologies I feel are valuable in the industry.</p>

        <p>While I've had some experience with Javascript I feel that given the time and effort, I can push my skills to creative new heights. It's important to stay focused and realize that programming is as mechanical as it is creative.</p>

        <img src="index-res/angularjs.png" alt="AngularJS">
        <p>Angular and Reactjs are both very powerful front end tools that have been dominating the industry for a long time now and when combined with other tools like Node.js and Express, the opportunities and limitations of what I can accomplish are endless.</p>

        <p>While I've obviously had a lot of fun with graphic design, art and the front end- the systems that make it all work have been one of my interests for a while. I'm very familiar with OOP languages like Python, so diving into the details will be exciting.</p>
