      <h1><u>Glitch Art</u></h1>
      <p>Glitch art has been a passion of mine for about two years now. It never gets old learning new ways to break computer logic and reasoning. It goes without saying that I've broken many a file, but I've never considered those failures. I've thought of them as methods of discovery for new ways to create beautiful new images. I've turned some pictures into sound, taken the hex code and inserted song lyrics, reformatted them in text editors and much, much more. Currently I'm working on a web app that makes it easy for the average person to make their own glitch art! Found below are some of my favorite pieces of work. Generally the style is characterized by misplaced RGB patterns, high saturation and sliding pixels- but the magic of it all is that it's so unpredictable what you'll get! I hope you enjoy looking at my work as much as I did making it.</p>

    <h1 class="text-center">What Do I mean by "Glitch Art?"</h1>
    <p class="text-center">When I refer to <em>Glitch Art</em> I literally mean that a file was broken or misinterpreted in some way. For example, if I purposefully "broke" my hard drive or graphics card (thankfully I'm not <em>that</em> commited to my craft) to achieve some desired outcome, that would be glitch art. If it broke on its own but created something pretty, I'd be impressed but it wouldn't be my work.</p>
    <p>That said, you may have more questions about <em>how</em> I make Glitch Art. For the more colorful pictures, namely the man looking out to the distance (from 2001 A Space Odyssey) as well as the couple laying down (from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) I imported them as raw data in Audacity, applied varying amounts of echo and checked what came of it. For the pictures that look more chopped up and mismatched, I took the hexidecimal code of the original pictures and inserted song lyrics. The picture with the woman wrapped in caution tape is actually Lady Gaga and I inserted lyrics to her song "Telephone." The picture of the Greek statue was done with a technique called pixel sorting. I used a programming language (I use that phrase loosely) called Processing to take pixels of generally the same value and drag them in different directions until I found something I liked.</p> <br> <br>

    <h1 class="text-center"><u>Photo Edits</u></h1>
    <p class="text-center art-paragraph">A lot of my time is spent photo editing as well. While my edits are nowhere near as unpredictable or esoteric as my Glitch Art, they absolutely are just as colorful. Generally I'm not the one behind the lens, sometimes I'm even in the pictures! My face, however, never appears in the pictures because I believe that people associate the meaning of pictures too closely with the people in them. In other words, while a lot of other artists view humanity or their human subjects as masters of their own destiny, products of their environments or various other things- my edits explore what things look like when a person is another aesthetic object <em>in</em> an environment.</p>
